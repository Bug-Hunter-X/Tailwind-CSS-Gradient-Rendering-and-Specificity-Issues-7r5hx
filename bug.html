```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes.  However, if the browser doesn't support the `linear-gradient` function or if the specified colors are invalid, it might not render correctly.  This could manifest as a blank box, a solid color, or other unexpected behavior.  It's especially problematic in older browsers.

Another case is unintended specificity issues. If another CSS rule with higher specificity targets the same element, it can override Tailwind's styles.
